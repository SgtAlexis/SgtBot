_Terms of Service_ ("terms") and _[Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md)_ ("policy").

You may invite the application to a server you have sufficient permissions for and use its sets of features on any
server you share with it. This privilege can be revoked and the application be removed from the server at any time,
should you violate these terms and/or policy, the _[Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)_ and/or
_[Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy)_ of _[Discord Inc.](https://discord.com)_, or their
_[Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)_.

Individuals of minimal age required to use _Discord_, as described in their _Terms of Service_ may use the application
and its features. Certain features are only available within text channels marked as "age-gated" (also known as "NSFW")
and may only be used by individuals of mature age. Granting access to these features for individuals underage of
maturity will result in a removal of the application from any server associated with the individual granting access to
these features for people under the age of maturity.

The owner of the application has faith in a users honesty and that the application may only be used for its intended
purpose and not in malicious ways against others or _Discord Inc_.

We reserve the right to update these terms and policy at our own discretion, giving a one-week period to opt out of the
changed terms and policy. You may opt out of these terms and policy by removing the application from any server you have
permission for and not using its features.
